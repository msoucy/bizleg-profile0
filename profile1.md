# Community Architecture

Your subject likely runs or contributes to one or more Open Source products or projects. Choose one (or more) of these and answer the following questions:


- Websites
	- [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/)

- Membership
	- Anyone can join
	- Fee based
	- Corporate
	- Individual

	- [and more](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/members)

- Board of directors
	- [About BOD](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/board-members)

- Raptor Test
	- Pass: Board of Directors with a set process to replace.

	- Funded by Linux Foundation
	- [Kernel.org](http://www.kernel.org/)
	- [Linux.com](http://www.linux.com/)

- If applicable, list and provide links to:
	- The project's IRC Channel
	- Source Code repository
	- Mail list archive
	- Documentation
	- Other communication channels
	- Project Website and/or Blog
- Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
- Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?
- Who approves patches? How many people?
- Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?
- Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
- Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
- Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?
- What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
- How is the project's participation trending and why?
- In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
- In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
- Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)
- Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?
- If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?
- Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
- Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

# Technology/Product

---
- The Linux Foundation is centered around promoting, standardizing, and protecting Linux.
- Linux is an open source operating system used on tons of platforms ranging from small embedded devices to large clusters of servers.
- Anyone needing a non-realtime operating system kernel could benefit from using Linux.
- Massive amounts of companies have a stake in the Linux kernel as well as the Linux Foundation. There are 185 corporate members of the Linux Foundation.
- One of the main reasons Linux became so popular was that it was open sourced and GPL licensed, which wasnâ€™t common when it was made.
