# Communications

## Social media for GitHub

- Twitter: https://twitter.com/github
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/githubstatus (Downtime reporting)
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/github

## Communications channels for GitHub

- GitHub’s press page lists all of their awards that they have received. (https://github.com/about/press)
- GitHub also has a blog that has lots of interesting posts. (https://github.com/blog)
- They also include a Glossary so writes can better report about what the company does. (https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)

## GitHub Conference Participation

- GitHub hosts “GitHub Universe” which is their own conference about working on open source projects as well as gathering tons of people working in open source. (http://githubuniverse.com/)
- GitHub also hosts “CodeConf” a two day conference about open source, best practices, documentation, and collaboration. (http://codeconf.com/)
- GitHub also attends several other conferences including GDC. (https://github.com/blog/1961-see-you-at-gdc)

# Community Architecture

## Project Name

- The project's IRC Channel
- Source Code repository
- Mail list archive
- Documentation
- Other communication channels
- Project Website and/or Blog

---

- Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
- Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?
- Who approves patches? How many people?
- Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?

---

- Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
- Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
- Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?
- What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

---

- How is the project's participation trending and why?
- In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
- In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
- Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

---

- Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?
- If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

---

- Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?
  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
- Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

## The Technology Behind GitHub

GitHub is powered completely by [Git][Git Wiki], a distributed source control system.

- Contrary to popular belief, Git existed before GitHub. GitHub created a nice visual front end and a great central area for code repos.
- Git was originally started by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel.
- Created to be a highly distributed SCM, GitHub based their entire product on using Git.
- Git was initially started to track the Linux kernel and was then used by other projects.
- GitHub now uses git as the tool it uses to track most of their repos and interface with GitHub.
- Lots of people interested in working on the same set of files or tracking changes in files could potentially use Git.

## Copyright Law and Creation of Git

- The Linux kernel was originally tracked in BitKeeper, a properitary SCM.
- Devs of BitKeeper resciended license to use it and the kernel was left in the cold.
- Linus became fed up and created his own that would be FOSS so that incident could never happen again.

## Controversy over GitHub and Copyright.

- GitHub is not open source, leading to an ironic situation that one of the most central sites for FOSS software isn’t FOSS itself.
- GitHub also has a default license that has been controversial over some of its terms.[][Git Wiki]
